# About Hong Kong Compiler Engineering Group

The Hong Kong Compiler Engineering Group is a community for anyone passionate about compiler development using OCaml. We focus on various stages of building a compiler—from syntax analysis to semantic analysis—and everything in between.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide a platform for compiler enthusiasts to:

- Learn about different phases of compiler construction: lexical analysis, parsing, type checking, optimization, and code generation.
- Discuss experiences and challenges with compiler design, or share insights on using functional programming, especially OCaml, for these tasks.
- Collaborate with others who are at various stages of their compiler projects.
- Explore advanced topics such as abstract syntax trees, control flow analysis, type systems, and more.

## Who Should Join

- OCaml enthusiasts
- Compiler hobbyists and experts
- Functional programming lovers
- Developers interested in language design

## What to Bring

- A laptop if you’d like to code together
- Any compiler project ideas or questions you want to discuss

We look forward to having you as part of our community!
