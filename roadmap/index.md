open Base
open Stdio

type id = string

type binop = Plus | Minus | Times | Div

type stm = Compound of stm * stm
     	| Assign of id * exp
     	| Print of exp list
and exp = Id of id
     	| Num of int
     	| Op of exp * binop * exp
     	| Eseq of stm * exp

(* Your code goes here >>> *)

(* Example AST representation in OCaml *)
let example_program = Compound(
  Assign("a", Op(Num 5, Plus, Num 3)),
  Compound(
	Assign("b",
  	Eseq(
    	Print [Id "a"; Op(Id "a", Minus, Num 1)],
    	Op(Num 10, Times, Id "a"))),
	Print [Id "b"]))

Nice intro article to learn about building lexers and parsers in Ocaml
https://dev.realworldocaml.org/parsing-with-ocamllex-and-menhir.html








Roadmap

1 week: Setup Ocaml. 1 chapter RWO. Play around Ocaml.
2 week: 


Read frist 6 chapters of Real world Ocaml to get familiar with syntax and language contstructions.

Read chapter 1 of THE BOOK, try to use ocaml to do exercise 1 from the book

Read chapter 19 of Real world ocaml to learn about ocamllex and menhir and how to build json lexer and parser with them

Read chapter 2 and 3 from THE BOOK to get theoretical knowledge about lexers and parsers and implement XML lexer and parser to practice ocamllex and menhir more

Switch to implementing Tiger language lexer and parser (TODO: add a link to the book)
