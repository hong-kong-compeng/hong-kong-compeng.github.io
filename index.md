Are you interested in compilers, functional programming, or exploring the intricate language design process? This group dives into the fascinating world of compiler development using OCaml!

We are an ongoing community for anyone passionate about the stages of building a compiler—from syntax analysis to semantic analysis—and everything in between. Whether you’re just starting or you’re a seasoned compiler enthusiast, this group is a great place to:

- Learn about different phases of compiler construction: lexical analysis, parsing, type checking, optimization, and code generation.
- Discuss experiences and challenges with compiler design, or share insights on using functional programming, especially OCaml, for these tasks.
- Collaborate with others who are at various stages of their compiler projects.
- Explore advanced topics such as abstract syntax trees, control flow analysis, type systems, and more.

We also have an ongoing onsite event you can join anytime in Hong Kong!

[Register for the event here](https://www.meetup.com/hong-kong-building-a-compiler-group)

Our members come from diverse backgrounds and may focus on different stages of compiler construction, providing opportunities to both teach and learn. Whether you’re interested in theory, implementation, or optimization, there’s something for everyone.

This is also a space to chat about compilers in general, the role of functional programming in compiler design, and share cool projects from the community.

Who should join:

- Compiler hobbyists and experts
- Functional programming lovers
- Developers interested in language design

No matter your experience level, this is the place for you if you’re passionate about compilers!

What to bring:

- A laptop if you’d like to code together
- Any compiler/programming language design project ideas or questions you want to discuss

We look forward to having you as part of our community!
